# Seismic Flow 

1) Setup Environment: Install OpenSeesPy and necessary libraries.
	- look for prebuilt docker containers to save time here

2) Prepare Mesh: Convert VTK mesh to OpenSeesPy format.
	- find tools/libraries to perform this conversion
	- see if possible to generate the mesh directly in this format

3) Define Model: Create nodes, elements, and materials in OpenSeesPy.
	- Figure out how to extract nodes, elements & assign material properties.

4) Apply Conditions: Set boundary conditions and seismic loads.
	- Set boundary conditions to simulate constraints at the base of the pit or along certain walls.
	- Apply seismic loads using ground motion records, or create synthetic records.
	- Make sure to list all loads so that we dont miss any and type of load 

5) Analysis Setup: Define analysis type and parameters.
	- type of analysis, static or dynamic. For seismic it is usually dynamic

6) Run Analysis: Execute the seismic analysis.
	-fragility curve, FoS applicable?
	
7) Post-Process: Visualize results for interpretation.
	- extraction & visualisation of the results using plotting libraries
